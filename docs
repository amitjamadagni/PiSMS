Documentation :

This repo is to send SMS using Raspberry Pi and Gnokii .

Different ways of using it :

1.Create a folder called web and move all the files onto server (i.e., /var/www/web) then grant the necessary permissions to the necessary files.

2.The user interface takes in a text file (with message and numnber separated by comma).

3.If the message includes comma then change the IFS(in sms.sh under scripts) to other parameter that separates the number and message.

4.Finally add sms1.sh to the crontab (Add by using crontab -e command and adding a line at the end)
     
     0-59/2 * * * * /var/www/web/sms1.sh
     
5.Run the script.sh by using ./script.sh and start uploading.
     
This would do the required job.

Other ways :

From the terminal run the file sms.sh with required text file.

# sms.sh (name_of_the_text_file)

Gnokii on raspberry pi can be got on the web.

Dont forget to change the config file and place it in the right direc.


Working structure:

Connect the phone to raspberry pi and check for the port and change the config file accordingly.

Then open the hosting page upload the file and ready to go.

The SMSC number has to be changed accordingly in the sms.sh file.

To increase the speed in initiating the process reduce the time in crontab -e.
